About Me
===
I am a math professor in the [Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science Department](https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/) at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu) in St Paul, Minnesota, USA.

I study combinatorics and graph theory, along with their applications to computer science. My research interests include random walks, random graphs, pursuit-evasion games, combinatorial games, social choice theory and network science.  


I earned my BA in Mathematics from [Williams College](https://math.williams.edu/), and my PhD in Mathematics from [Yale University](https://math.yale.edu/), where I was advised by [László Lovász](https://web.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/). I held post-doctoral positions at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/math/index.html) where I was mentored by [Alan Frieze](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~af1p/). I also spent half a dozen years as a software developer in Silicon Valley before personal epiphony impelled me back into academia. I am really proud to be part of the Macalester MSCS Department, where my colleagues work hard, play nice, and take care of one another.
