I am a math professor in the [Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science Department](https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/) at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu) in St Paul, Minnesota, USA.

I study combinatorics and graph theory, along with their applications to computer science. My research interests include random walks, random graphs, pursuit-evasion games, combinatorial games, social choice theory and network science.  


I earned my BA in Mathematics from [Williams College](https://math.williams.edu/), and my PhD in Mathematics from [Yale University](https://math.yale.edu/), where I was advised by [László Lovász](https://web.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/). I was a post-doctoral vistor at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/math/index.html) where I was mentored by [Alan Frieze](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~af1p/). I also spent half a dozen years as a software developer in Silicon Valley before personal epiphany impelled me back into academia. I am really proud to be part of the Macalester MSCS Department, where my colleagues  and students work hard, play nice, and take care of one another.

Network of Thrones
====

In 2016, a student and I published [an introductory article](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Mathhorizons/NetworkofThrones%20%281%29.pdf) for [MAA Math Horizons](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/math-horizons) that performed a network analysis for "A Storm of Swords," the third book in George R. R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" series. Our result went viral, thanks to a playful [Quartz article by Adam Epstein](http://qz.com/650796/mathematicians-mapped-out-every-game-of-thrones-relationship-to-find-the-main-character/) about it. Performing network analysis of ASOIF and "Game of Thrones" (the HBO adaptation) became a hobby for me. My [Network of Thrones](https://networkofthrones.wordpress.com/) blog collects the resulting observations. This project also led to a really [interesting academic collaboration](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByVwdYPtCB8eQngtdUljZFgyRUE) with [Michael Chemers](https://theater.ucsc.edu/faculty/chemers) that combined data science with the poetics of performed work.
