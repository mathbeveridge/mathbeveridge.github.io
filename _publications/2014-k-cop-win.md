excerpt: 'The cop number of a graph is the minimum number of cops needs to capture a robber moving between vertices of the graph. We prove that the minimum order of a connected graph with cop number 3 is 10 and that the Petersen graph is the unique 3-cop-win graph on 10 vertices.'

The cop number of a graph is the minimum number of cops needs to capture a robber moving between vertices of the graph. We consider the minimum order graphs with a given cop number. 
We prove that the minimum order of a connected graph with cop number 3 is 10, and show that the Petersen graph is the unique isomorphism type of graph with this property. 
We provide the results of a computational search on the cop number of all graphs up to and including order 10. 
A relationship is presented between the minimum order of graph with cop number k and Meyniel's conjecture on the asymptotic maximum value of the cop number of a connected graph.
