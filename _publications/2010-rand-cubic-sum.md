Choose each element of $\mathbb{Z}_2^d$ independently with probability $p$. 
Then construct the graph such that there is an edge between $a$ and $b$  if and only if vertex $a+b$ also appears in the graph.
We determine threshold functions for various properties of this random graph, including connectivity.
