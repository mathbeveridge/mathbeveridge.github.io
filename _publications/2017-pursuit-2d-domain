We prove two general results about pursuit-evasion games in topological space, where the pursuer must obtain colocation to achieve capture.
Firstly, one pursuer has a winning strategy in any CAT(0) space.
Secondly, three pursuers hava a winning strategy in a compact domain in Euclidean two-space with piecewise analytic boundary and arbitrary Euler characteristic.
