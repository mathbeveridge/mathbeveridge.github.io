The discrete Green&#39;s function (without boundary) is a pseudo-inverse of the combinatorial Laplace operator of a graph. 
We reveal the intimate connection between Green&#39;s function and the theory of exact stopping rules for random walks on graphs. 
We give an elementary formula for Green&#39;s function in terms of state-to-state hitting times of the underlying graph.
