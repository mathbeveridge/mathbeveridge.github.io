excerpt: 'We consider four Maker-Breaker games played on random geometric graphs. For each of our four games we show that if we add edges between $n$ points chosen uniformly at random in the unit square by order of increasing edge-length then, with probability tending to one as $n \rightarrow \infty$, the graph becomes Maker-win the very moment it satisfies a simple necessary condition.

In a Maker-Breaker game on a graph G, Breaker and Maker alternately claim edges of G. Maker wins if, after all edges have been claimed, the graph induced by his edges has some desired property. 
We consider four Maker-Breaker games played on random geometric graphs: the connectivity game, the Hamilton cycle game, the perfect matching game, and the subgraph game. 
For each of our four games we show that if we add edges between $n$ points chosen uniformly at random in the unit square by order of increasing edge-length then, with probability tending to one as $n \rightarrow \infty$, the graph becomes Maker-win the very moment it satisfies a simple necessary condition.
