excerpt: 'We consider two distinct centers which arise in measuring how quickly a random walk on a tree mixes. Optimal stopping rules lead to a variety of natural notions of centrality. Each of these criteria identifies the barycenter of the tree as the &quot;average&quot; center and the newly defined focus as the &quot;extremal&quot; center.'

We consider two distinct centers which arise in measuring how quickly a random walk
on a tree mixes. Optimal stopping rules lead to a variety of natural notions of centrality.
Each of these criteria identifies the barycenter of the tree as the &quot;average&quot;
center and the newly defined focus as the &quot;extremal&quot; center.
