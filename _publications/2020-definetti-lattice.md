Let F be the collection of subsets of [n]={1,2,...,n} of size at most 2 with the partial order rule
i<j implies {i}≺{j} and  {i,k}≺{j,k}. We show that the number of linear extensions of F is counted by the [strict sense ballot numbers]{https://oeis.org/A003121}. 
More surprisingly, we show that the number of partial orders so that all singletons are comparable with all doubletons is counted by the [Robbins numbers]{https://oeis.org/A005130},
which is also the number of alternating sign matrices.
