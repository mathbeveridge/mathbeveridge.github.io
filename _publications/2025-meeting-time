Consider a random walk on a tree $G=(V,E)$. For $v,w \in V$, let the hitting time $H(v,w)$ denote 
the expected number of steps required for the random walk started at $v$ to reach $w$, and let 
$\pi_v = \deg(v)/2|E|$ denote the stationary distribution for the random walk. 
We characterize the extremal tree structures for the meeting time
$T_{\mathrm{meet}}(G) = \max_{w \in V} \sum_{v \in V} \pi_v H(v,w)$. 
For fixed order $n$ and diameter $d$, the meeting time is maximized by the broom graph. 
The meeting time is minimized by the balanced double broom graph, or a slight variant, 
depending on the relative parities of $n$ and $d$.
