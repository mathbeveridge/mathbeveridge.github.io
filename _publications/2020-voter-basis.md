When making n simultaneous decisions (for example, in a referendum election), our preference for the outcomes on one subset can depend on the outcomes on a disjoint subset. 
A subset S is <i>separable</i> when the reverse is true: our preference ranking on the outcomes of S are independent of the other outcomes. 
The <i>admissibility problem</i> asks which collections of subsets can correspond to the separable sets of some preference order. 
We use linear algebraic techniques to construct a preference order whose separable subsets have a tree structure with respect to subset inclusion.
