We study the mixing time of random graphs in the $d$-dimensional toric unit cube generated by the geographical threshold graph (GTG) model, a generalization of random geometric graphs (RGG).
If the weight distribution function decays with $P[Wâ‰¥x]=O(x^{-d+\nu})$ for an arbitrarily small $\nu >0$ 
then the mixing time of GTG is at least as fast as that of the corresponding random geometric graph (RGG).
