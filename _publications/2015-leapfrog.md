First, we fully characterize when an environment with a single obstacles is one-pursuer-win or two-pursuer-win. 
Second, we give sufficient (but not necessary) conditions for an environment to have a winning strategy for two pursuers. 
Such environments can be swept by a <i>leapfrog strategy</i> in which the two pursuers alternately guard or increase the currently controlled area.
More concretely, for an environment with n vertices, we describe an $O(n^2)$ algorithm that (1) determines whether the obstacles are well-separated, and if so, 
(2) constructs the required partition for a leapfrog strategy.
