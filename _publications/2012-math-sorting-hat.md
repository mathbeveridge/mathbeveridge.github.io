We describe the development and implementation of an automated procedure for assigning first-year students to seminars at Macalester College.
The heart of the procedure is to find a minium weight perfect matching on a bipartite graph using the Hungarian algorithm.

Note: we improved this procedure in later years using integer linear programming.
