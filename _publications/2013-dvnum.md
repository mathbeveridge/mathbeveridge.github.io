excerpt: 'A $k$-bar visibility representation of a digraph $$G assigns each vertex at most $k$ horizontal segments in the plane so that $G$ has an arc $uv$ if and only if some segment for $u$ &quote;sees&quot; some segment for $v$ above it by a vertical line of sight. 
The (bar) visibility number $b(G)$ of a digraph $G$ is the least $k$ permitting such a representation. We prove bounds on the bar visibility of planar digraphs and tournaments.'

A $k$-bar visibility representation of a digraph $$G assigns each vertex at most $k$ horizontal
segments in the plane so that $G$ has an arc $uv$ if and only if some segment for $u$ &quote;sees&quot;
some segment for $v$ above it by a vertical line of sight. 
The (bar) visibility number $b(G)$ of a digraph $G$ is the least $k$ permitting such a representation. 
We prove bounds on the bar visibility of planar digraphs and tournaments.
