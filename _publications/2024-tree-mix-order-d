We characterize the extremal structure for the exact mixing time for random walks on trees
$T_{n,d}$ of order $n$ with diameter $d$. Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, let $H(v,\pi)$ denote the 
expected length of an optimal stopping rule from vertex $v$ to the stationary distributon $\pi$. 
We show that the quantity 
$\max_{G \in T_{n,d}} T_{\mathrm{mix}}(G) = \max_{G \in T_{n,d}}  \max_{v \in V} H(v, \pi)$
is achieved uniquely by the balanced double broom.
